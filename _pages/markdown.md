It is a personal web of a pharmacy analysis doctor. "Doctor" has lots of meanings in English, sometimes it means an academic degree, sometimes it means a career, and sometimes means a verb which refers to deceiving. Of course something in this page is not real in order to keep someone's privacy.
 
Although it is made for his homework at first, the author thinks it an interesting thing to write codes. Feelings of an omnipotent creator hugs him, which brings him much more happiness than his major work, namely endless and irreproducible wet experiments. Everyone should have a try to become a programmer in my opinion. Thanks for such a wonderful experience.
