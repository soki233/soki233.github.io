Again, it is a personal web of a pharmacy analysis doctor. "Doctor" has lots of meanings in English, sometimes it means an academic degree, sometimes it means a career, and sometimes means a verb which refers to deceiving. Of course something in this page is not real in order to keep someone's privacy.

As you can see, this web is much simpler than the original template. That results from the terrible time management ability of the author. Wish he had more time next time.
 
Although it is made for his homework at first, the author thinks it an interesting thing to write codes. Feelings of an omnipotent creator hugs him, which brings him much more happiness than his major work, namely endless and irreproducible wet experiments. Everyone should have a try to become a programmer in his opinion. Thanks for such a wonderful experience.
