I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Phamacy Analysis at the [school of pharmaceutical sciences](https://sps.bjmu.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xianchan Li](http://dpa.sps.bjmu.edu.cn/gbenglish/Faculty2022/Professor/2aba88aca18b4ad39b1eb00785a138f1.htm). My research interests include nanopore, electrochemistry and analytical chemistry.

You can find my Chinese CV here: [CV of pure passer-by](assets/CV of LCQ.pdf), or tend to the CV page to find more about me.

Here is my [WechatCode](images/mywechat.jpg) for anyone needed. I'm always online.
